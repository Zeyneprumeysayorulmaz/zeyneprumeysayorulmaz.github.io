🎓 I graduated from Gazi University Computer Engineering program. I am a passionate researcher and open source enthusiast. I am interested in System & Network, Cloud Computing and Cyber Security and I am developing myself accordingly. I created this blog, hoping to share my work and wish it to be a resource.


For your questions and suggestions about the studies, it is sufficient to send an e-mail or contact via linkedin. I am always open to feedback and criticisms to improve the work. 😊
